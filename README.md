Hello visitor

This is my first project regarding coding. In this project I have used HTML and CSS, with some JS scripts, mainly Masonry.js which is a grid layout library from https://masonry.desandro.com/

This project has two uses for me:
Firstly it is for me to train my coding skills, getting into the workflow of using Git and GitHub as well as understanding what goes into coding a website.
Secondly it is a portfolio page where I can showcase my work, both in media like photography and film making, as well as in webdevelopment where I hope to showcase a lot of projects.
