          <h2>Hey, my name is Levent</h2>
          <p>
            I am a business student based in Copenhagen who has always had a
            passion for design, creativity, and technology. <br />
            The main areas of my work are in
            <b>photography, filmmaking, and webdevelopment.</b> I am currently
            very interested in improving my skills in webdevelopment and have a
            career in that field as a front-end developer. <br />
            I love learning and gaining new skills. I have through hard work and
            hobbies developed valuable skills within different areas. I am a
            heavy <b>photoshop</b> user for 8 years and have experience in
            <b>graphical work and photography.</b> It started out as a hobby and
            an interest, but my passion has lead to professional work. <br />
            For the past year I have been involved with handling websites. I
            have been teaching myself how to code websites and I am currently
            learning <b>JavaScript.</b>
            This portfolio showcases the digital work I have done for companies
            as well as personal projects.

            My work at Retail Brands - Hotel Chocolat & Swarovski in the Nordic
          </h2>
          <p>
            Working at Retail Brands taught me how to work with important
            international brands. Retail Brands was a Danish retail company that
            covered Hotel Chocolat and Swarovski in the Nordic market. I was a
            student worker who was responsible for administrating and managing
            their e-Commerce store and creating content through graphical
            programs for their marketing. Their website was based on Dynamicweb
            which is a no-code platform that combined CMS, Ecommerce, Marketing,
            and PIM.
            <br />
            I honed my skills in graphical work while working in the marketing
            department where I had to create pictures for the website as well as
            social media posts. Underneath is some examples of my work.

          <h2>My own website</h2>
          <p>
            Working at Retail Brands showed me that there were limits to how one
            can work with site builders based on no-coding. I researched about
            different site builders in order to figure out the limitations and
            strengths of them and find where I can realise the ideas that I
            have. I started researching more about how one can code websites and
            became interested in the possibilities that open up that way and how
            much there is to learn. Learning HTML and CSS would give me the
            basic tools in order to design webpages just how I imagine them to
            be. I have since then taught myself how to code with HTML and CSS
            and I can proudly say that this website is built from scratch by
            myself. <br />
            <br />
            If you are interested then you can contact me for any inquries.
