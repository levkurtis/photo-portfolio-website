            <p>Hi, my name is Levent Kurtis and I am a Danish born business student based in Copenhagen and have always had a passion for design, creativity, and technology. 
                Since little I have had a big interest in photography, filmmaking, and computers. I have always been interested in working on ideas that I had and creating stuff from scratch. 
                I have a big interest in websites. As a business student, I see many opportunities with websites for businesses and I understand the importance for a business to have a strong digital footprint and a presentable platform. I have been teaching myself web-development, as I find it particularly interesting that websites incorporate stuff from the creative world through design and more, but also are products of an idea which have been realised through hard work. This way I hope to combine my multiple skills and create something that I can be proud of.
                
                This portfolio will showcase some of the various digital work that I have done.</p>
